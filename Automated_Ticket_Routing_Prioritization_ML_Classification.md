# Automated Ticket Routing & Prioritization (ML Classification)

## 1. Project Introduction (Elevator Pitch)

### One-liner Goal
The Automated Ticket Routing & Prioritization system is a machine learning classification solution that automatically routes IT support tickets to the most appropriate agents and assigns optimal priority levels, reducing manual overhead and improving response times.

### Domain & Business Problem
IT support teams spend significant time manually routing tickets and determining priorities, leading to delays, misrouting, and inconsistent prioritization. This results in poor customer experience and inefficient resource utilization.

**Industry Context:**
- IT support handles 500+ tickets daily in medium enterprises
- Manual routing takes 15-30 minutes per ticket
- 25% of tickets are misrouted initially
- Priority assignment accuracy: 60-70%
- Average first response time: 4-6 hours

## 2. Problem Statement

### Exact Pain Points Being Solved
- **Manual Routing Overhead**: 20% of support time spent on ticket routing
- **Misrouting**: 25% of tickets routed to wrong agents initially
- **Inconsistent Prioritization**: 30% variation in priority assignment
- **Response Delays**: 4-6 hour average first response time
- **Resource Inefficiency**: Poor workload distribution across teams

## 3. Data Understanding

### Data Sources
- **Ticket Management Systems**: ServiceNow, Jira, Zendesk
- **Agent Profiles**: Skills, experience, workload, performance
- **Historical Data**: Past routing decisions and outcomes
- **Customer Data**: Priority, department, location
- **System Logs**: Infrastructure alerts and performance data

### Volume & Type
- **Ticket Records**: 100,000+ historical tickets
- **Agent Data**: 500+ support staff profiles
- **Routing Decisions**: 50,000+ routing outcomes
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, resolution rates

## 4. Data Preprocessing

### Feature Engineering
```python
class TicketRouter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agent_profiles = {}
        self.routing_rules = {}
    
    def create_routing_features(self, ticket_data):
        # Ticket characteristics
        ticket_data['complexity_score'] = self.calculate_complexity(ticket_data)
        ticket_data['urgency_score'] = self.calculate_urgency(ticket_data)
        
        # Agent availability
        ticket_data['agent_workload'] = self.get_agent_workload()
        ticket_data['skill_match'] = self.calculate_skill_match(ticket_data)
        
        # Historical patterns
        ticket_data['similar_ticket_routing'] = self.find_similar_tickets(ticket_data)
        
        return ticket_data
    
    def calculate_complexity(self, ticket):
        # Based on description length, category, attachments
        complexity = (
            len(ticket['description']) * 0.3 +
            ticket['category_complexity'] * 0.4 +
            ticket['attachment_count'] * 0.3
        )
        return complexity
    
    def calculate_urgency(self, ticket):
        # Based on priority, customer tier, business impact
        urgency = (
            ticket['priority_score'] * 0.4 +
            ticket['customer_tier'] * 0.3 +
            ticket['business_impact'] * 0.3
        )
        return urgency
```

## 5. Model / Approach

### Machine Learning Algorithms
- **Routing Classification**: Random Forest for agent assignment
- **Priority Classification**: XGBoost for priority level prediction
- **Ensemble Model**: Voting classifier for final decisions
- **Baseline Model**: Rule-based system for comparison

### Model Training
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import xgboost as xgb

class RoutingModel:
    def train_routing_classifier(self, X, y):
        rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(
            n_estimators=100,
            max_depth=10,
            random_state=42
        )
        rf_model.fit(X, y)
        return rf_model
    
    def train_priority_classifier(self, X, y):
        xgb_model = xgb.XGBClassifier(
            n_estimators=100,
            max_depth=6,
            random_state=42
        )
        xgb_model.fit(X, y)
