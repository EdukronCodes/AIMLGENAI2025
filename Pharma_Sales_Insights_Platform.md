# Pharma Sales Insights Platform

## 1. Project Introduction (Elevator Pitch)

### One-liner Goal
The Pharma Sales Insights Platform is a comprehensive data analytics solution designed to transform pharmaceutical sales data into actionable business intelligence, enabling data-driven decision making for pharmaceutical companies to optimize their sales strategies and market performance.

### Domain & Business Problem
The pharmaceutical industry operates in a highly competitive and regulated environment where sales performance directly impacts revenue and market share. Traditional sales analysis methods rely heavily on manual reporting and basic spreadsheet analysis, which are time-consuming, error-prone, and lack real-time insights. Pharmaceutical companies face challenges in understanding market trends, identifying high-potential territories, optimizing sales force allocation, and predicting future sales performance.

**Industry Context:**
- The global pharmaceutical market is valued at over $1.5 trillion annually
- Sales teams operate across multiple territories with varying market conditions
- Regulatory compliance requires detailed tracking and reporting
- Market competition demands rapid response to changing conditions

**Why This Project is Needed:**
- Manual sales analysis takes weeks to complete, delaying strategic decisions
- Lack of real-time visibility into sales performance across territories
- Inability to identify patterns and trends in historical sales data
- Difficulty in predicting future sales based on market conditions
- Inefficient allocation of sales resources across different regions

## 2. Problem Statement

### Exact Pain Points Being Solved

**Primary Challenges:**
- **Delayed Decision Making**: Sales managers spend 40% of their time on data collection and basic reporting instead of strategic analysis
- **Territory Performance Blind Spots**: Inability to identify underperforming territories and understand root causes
- **Resource Allocation Inefficiency**: Sales representatives are not optimally distributed based on market potential
- **Predictive Capability Gap**: No systematic approach to forecast sales trends and market opportunities
- **Data Silos**: Sales data exists in multiple disconnected systems (CRM, ERP, market research databases)

### Measurable Challenges Before Solution

**Quantified Problems:**
- Average time to generate sales reports: 3-5 business days
- Territory performance analysis accuracy: 65% (based on manual calculations)
- Sales forecasting accuracy: 72% (using traditional methods)
- Time spent on data preparation: 60% of total analysis time
- Number of missed opportunities due to delayed insights: 15-20% monthly

**Operational Impact:**
- Sales team productivity reduced by 30% due to administrative overhead
- Revenue loss of approximately $2.5M annually due to suboptimal territory allocation
- Customer response time increased by 48 hours due to delayed insights
- Market share erosion in competitive territories by 8-12%

import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, LabelEncoder

def clean_sales_data(df):
    # Remove duplicates
    df = df.drop_duplicates(subset=['transaction_id', 'customer_id'])
    
    # Handle missing values
    df['territory_code'] = df['territory_code'].fillna('UNKNOWN')
    df['sales_amount'] = df['sales_amount'].fillna(df['sales_amount'].median())
    
    # Standardize territory codes
    df['territory_code'] = df['territory_code'].str.upper().str.strip()
    
    # Remove outliers using IQR method
    Q1 = df['sales_amount'].quantile(0.25)
    Q3 = df['sales_amount'].quantile(0.75)
    IQR = Q3 - Q1
    df = df[(df['sales_amount'] >= Q1 - 1.5*IQR) & 
            (df['sales_amount'] <= Q3 + 1.5*IQR)]
    
    return df
```

**Feature Engineering:**
```python
# Feature engineering for sales analysis
def create_sales_features(df):
    # Time-based features
    df['year'] = pd.to_datetime(df['transaction_date']).dt.year
    df['month'] = pd.to_datetime(df['transaction_date']).dt.month
    df['quarter'] = pd.to_datetime(df['transaction_date']).dt.quarter
    df['day_of_week'] = pd.to_datetime(df['transaction_date']).dt.dayofweek
    
    # Rolling statistics
    df['sales_30d_avg'] = df.groupby('territory_code')['sales_amount'].rolling(30).mean().reset_index(0, drop=True)
    df['sales_90d_avg'] = df.groupby('territory_code')['sales_amount'].rolling(90).mean().reset_index(0, drop=True)
    
    # Market share calculations
    df['market_share'] = df['sales_amount'] / df.groupby(['territory_code', 'month'])['sales_amount'].transform('sum')
    
    # Growth rates
    df['sales_growth'] = df.groupby('territory_code')['sales_amount'].pct_change()
    
    return df
```

def preprocess_market_text(text):
    # Convert to lowercase
    text = text.lower()
    
    # Remove special characters
    text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z\s]', '', text)
    
    # Tokenization
    tokens = word_tokenize(text)
    
    # Remove stopwords
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    tokens = [word for word in tokens if word not in stop_words]
    
    # Lemmatization
    lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
    tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in tokens]
    
    return ' '.join(tokens)
```

### Data Normalization & Standardization

**Scaling Operations:**
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler

def normalize_features(df, numerical_columns):
    # Standard scaling for features with normal distribution
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    df[numerical_columns] = scaler.fit_transform(df[numerical_columns])
    
    return df, scaler

def encode_categorical_features(df, categorical_columns):
    # Label encoding for categorical variables
    label_encoders = {}
    for col in categorical_columns:
        le = LabelEncoder()
        df[col] = le.fit_transform(df[col])
        label_encoders[col] = le
    
    return df, label_encoders
