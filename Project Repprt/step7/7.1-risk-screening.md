# 7.1 Propose Improved Risk Screening Methods

## Introduction

Risk screening is the cornerstone of loan approval processes, determining which applicants are likely to repay their loans and which pose higher default risks. Traditional screening methods often rely on limited data points and manual processes, leading to inconsistencies, biases, and missed opportunities. This section explores innovative approaches to risk screening that leverage advanced analytics, machine learning, and comprehensive data sources to create more accurate, fair, and efficient assessment methods.

## Current Limitations in Risk Screening

Traditional risk screening methods face several challenges:
- **Limited Data Sources:** Relying primarily on credit scores and basic financial information
- **Manual Processes:** Human judgment introducing bias and inconsistency
- **Static Models:** Inflexible approaches that don't adapt to changing conditions
- **Narrow Focus:** Missing alternative data that could improve predictions
- **Bias Issues:** Systematic discrimination against certain demographic groups
