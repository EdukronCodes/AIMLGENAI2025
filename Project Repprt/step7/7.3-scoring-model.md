- **Alternative Credit Scoring:** Non-traditional data-based scoring methods

### 2. Risk Scoring Models
- **Default Risk Models:** Predicting likelihood of loan default
- **Fraud Detection Models:** Identifying potentially fraudulent applications
- **Prepayment Risk Models:** Assessing likelihood of early loan repayment
- **Portfolio Risk Models:** Managing overall loan portfolio risk

### 3. Application Scoring Models
- **Approval Scoring:** Overall application approval likelihood
- **Pricing Models:** Determining appropriate interest rates and terms
- **Limit Models:** Setting appropriate loan amounts
- **Product Matching:** Recommending suitable loan products
