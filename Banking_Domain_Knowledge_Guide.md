## 2. Core Banking Terminology

### Account & Transaction Terms
- **Demand Deposit Account (DDA)**: Checking account with immediate access to funds - The most common type of bank account that allows customers to deposit and withdraw funds at any time without advance notice. DDAs typically offer check-writing privileges, debit card access, and online banking capabilities, making them essential for daily financial transactions and cash management.
- **Time Deposit Account**: Savings account with interest and withdrawal restrictions - Interest-bearing accounts that require customers to keep funds deposited for a specified period to earn higher interest rates. These accounts help banks manage liquidity by providing predictable funding sources while offering customers better returns than regular savings accounts.
- **Certificate of Deposit (CD)**: Time deposit with fixed term and interest rate - A financial product that offers a guaranteed return over a specific time period, typically ranging from a few months to several years. CDs provide higher interest rates than regular savings accounts in exchange for the customer's commitment to leave funds untouched for the specified term.
- **Money Market Account**: Interest-bearing account with check-writing privileges - A hybrid account that combines the interest-earning benefits of savings accounts with the transaction capabilities of checking accounts. Money market accounts typically offer higher interest rates than regular savings accounts while allowing limited check-writing and debit card transactions.
- **Overdraft**: Negative balance when account has insufficient funds - A situation where a customer's account balance falls below zero due to transactions exceeding available funds. Banks may charge overdraft fees and offer overdraft protection services to help customers avoid declined transactions and additional fees.
- **ACH (Automated Clearing House)**: Electronic funds transfer system - A nationwide electronic payment system that processes large volumes of credit and debit transactions in batches. ACH is used for direct deposits, bill payments, and other recurring transactions, offering a cost-effective alternative to paper checks and wire transfers.
- **Wire Transfer**: Real-time electronic funds transfer - An electronic method of transferring funds between banks or financial institutions in real-time. Wire transfers are typically used for large, time-sensitive transactions and offer immediate settlement, though they usually carry higher fees than ACH transfers.
- **SWIFT**: International wire transfer network - The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication provides a secure messaging network that enables banks worldwide to send and receive information about financial transactions. SWIFT is essential for international trade, cross-border payments, and global financial communication.

### Lending Terms
- **Principal**: Original amount borrowed - The initial amount of money borrowed from a bank, which represents the base amount upon which interest is calculated. The principal is the core debt that must be repaid, and it decreases as the borrower makes payments according to the loan's amortization schedule. Understanding principal is essential for calculating interest payments, determining loan costs, and planning repayment strategies.
- **Interest**: Cost of borrowing money - The fee charged by banks for lending money, typically expressed as a percentage of the principal amount. Interest compensates banks for the risk of lending, the opportunity cost of using their capital, and the administrative costs of loan management. Interest rates vary based on credit risk, loan term, market conditions, and the type of loan product offered.
- **Annual Percentage Rate (APR)**: Total cost of credit expressed as yearly rate - A standardized measure that includes both the interest rate and other loan costs such as origination fees, closing costs, and other charges. APR provides borrowers with a comprehensive view of the true cost of borrowing, enabling them to compare different loan offers on an equal basis. This metric is required by law to be disclosed to consumers and helps prevent misleading loan advertising.
- **Amortization**: Gradual repayment of loan principal over time - The process of systematically paying off a loan over time through regular payments that include both principal and interest. In the early years of an amortized loan, payments consist mostly of interest, while later payments consist mostly of principal. This structure ensures that the loan is fully repaid by the end of the term while providing predictable payment amounts for borrowers.
- **Collateral**: Asset pledged to secure a loan - Property or assets that a borrower offers as security for a loan, which the bank can seize and sell if the borrower defaults on the loan. Collateral reduces the bank's risk and typically results in lower interest rates for borrowers. Common types of collateral include real estate, vehicles, equipment, and financial assets like stocks or bonds.
- **Credit Score**: Numerical representation of creditworthiness - A standardized number that represents a borrower's likelihood of repaying debt based on their credit history, payment patterns, and financial behavior. Credit scores range from 300 to 850, with higher scores indicating better creditworthiness and typically resulting in lower interest rates and better loan terms. Banks use credit scores to assess risk and determine loan eligibility and pricing.
- **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**: Monthly debt payments divided by monthly income - A key metric used by banks to evaluate a borrower's ability to manage additional debt payments. DTI is calculated by dividing total monthly debt obligations by gross monthly income, with lower ratios indicating better debt management capacity. Most banks prefer DTI ratios below 43% for mortgage loans and below 36% for other consumer loans.
- **Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV)**: Loan amount divided by property value - A risk assessment metric that compares the loan amount to the appraised value of the property being financed. Lower LTV ratios indicate less risk for the bank, as the borrower has more equity in the property and is less likely to default. LTV ratios above 80% typically require private mortgage insurance (PMI) to protect the bank against potential losses.

### Investment Terms
- **Portfolio**: Collection of investments - A diversified collection of financial assets including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, and other investment vehicles held by an individual or institution. Portfolios are designed to achieve specific financial goals while managing risk through diversification across different asset classes, sectors, and geographic regions. Effective portfolio management involves regular rebalancing, risk assessment, and performance monitoring to ensure alignment with investment objectives.
- **Asset Allocation**: Distribution of investments across asset classes - The strategic distribution of investment capital across different asset categories such as stocks, bonds, cash, real estate, and alternative investments. Asset allocation is one of the most important decisions in investment management, as it determines the portfolio's risk and return characteristics. The optimal allocation depends on factors such as investment time horizon, risk tolerance, financial goals, and market conditions.
- **Diversification**: Spreading investments to reduce risk - An investment strategy that spreads capital across multiple investments, asset classes, sectors, and geographic regions to reduce the impact of any single investment's poor performance on the overall portfolio. Diversification helps minimize unsystematic risk and can improve risk-adjusted returns by reducing portfolio volatility. The goal is to create a portfolio where the positive performance of some investments offsets the negative performance of others.
- **Yield**: Return on investment expressed as percentage - The income return on an investment, typically expressed as an annual percentage of the investment's current market value or cost. Yield can come from various sources including interest payments on bonds, dividends on stocks, or rental income from real estate. Yield is an important metric for income-focused investors and helps compare the income-generating potential of different investments.
- **Capital Gains**: Profit from selling investments - The profit realized when an investment is sold for more than its purchase price, representing the appreciation in the investment's value over time. Capital gains can be short-term (held for one year or less) or long-term (held for more than one year), with different tax treatment for each. Understanding capital gains is essential for tax planning and investment decision-making.
- **Dividend**: Distribution of company profits to shareholders - A portion of a company's earnings distributed to shareholders, typically paid quarterly in cash or additional shares of stock. Dividends provide regular income to investors and are often seen as a sign of a company's financial health and stability. Dividend-paying stocks are particularly attractive to income-focused investors and retirees seeking regular cash flow from their investments.
- **Bond**: Fixed-income security representing a loan to issuer - A debt security where an investor lends money to an entity (government, corporation, or municipality) for a defined period at a fixed or variable interest rate. Bonds provide regular interest payments and return the principal at maturity, making them attractive for income generation and capital preservation. Bonds are generally considered less risky than stocks but offer lower potential returns.
- **Mutual Fund**: Pooled investment vehicle - An investment vehicle that pools money from multiple investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities managed by professional investment managers. Mutual funds offer individual investors access to diversified portfolios, professional management, and economies of scale that would be difficult to achieve independently. They provide convenience and diversification but typically charge management fees and may have minimum investment requirements.

### Risk Management Terms
- **Credit Risk**: Risk of borrower default - The risk that a borrower will fail to meet their debt obligations, resulting in financial losses for the bank. Credit risk is one of the most significant risks banks face and is managed through careful underwriting, credit scoring, collateral requirements, and ongoing monitoring of borrower financial health. Banks use sophisticated models to assess credit risk and set appropriate interest rates and loan terms based on risk levels.
- **Market Risk**: Risk of investment value fluctuations - The risk of losses due to changes in market prices, interest rates, exchange rates, or other market factors that affect the value of a bank's investment portfolio or trading positions. Market risk includes interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange risk, and commodity risk. Banks manage market risk through diversification, hedging strategies, position limits, and sophisticated risk measurement models.
- **Operational Risk**: Risk of internal process failures - The risk of losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or external events. Operational risk includes risks from fraud, system failures, human error, legal issues, and natural disasters. Banks manage operational risk through robust internal controls, employee training, technology investments, insurance coverage, and comprehensive risk assessment frameworks.
- **Liquidity Risk**: Risk of inability to meet financial obligations - The risk that a bank will be unable to meet its short-term financial obligations due to insufficient cash or liquid assets. Liquidity risk can arise from deposit withdrawals, loan commitments, or market disruptions that prevent the bank from accessing funding sources. Banks manage liquidity risk through maintaining adequate liquid assets, diversifying funding sources, and developing contingency funding plans.
- **Interest Rate Risk**: Risk of interest rate changes affecting profitability - The risk that changes in interest rates will adversely affect a bank's net interest income, asset values, or overall profitability. Interest rate risk occurs when there are mismatches between the maturities or repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. Banks manage this risk through asset-liability management, interest rate hedging, and maintaining balanced portfolios of rate-sensitive assets and liabilities.
- **Compliance Risk**: Risk of regulatory violations - The risk of financial losses, legal penalties, or reputational damage due to failure to comply with laws, regulations, or industry standards. Compliance risk includes risks from anti-money laundering violations, consumer protection laws, capital requirements, and other regulatory requirements. Banks manage compliance risk through robust compliance programs, regular audits, employee training, and close monitoring of regulatory developments.
- **Capital Adequacy**: Sufficient capital to absorb potential losses - The requirement that banks maintain sufficient capital to absorb potential losses and continue operating during adverse economic conditions. Capital adequacy is measured through regulatory ratios such as the Basel III capital requirements, which ensure banks have enough high-quality capital relative to their risk-weighted assets. Adequate capital protects depositors, maintains financial stability, and supports continued lending during economic downturns.
- **Stress Testing**: Analysis of bank performance under adverse conditions - A risk management tool that evaluates how a bank would perform under various adverse economic scenarios, including severe recessions, market crashes, or other stress conditions. Stress testing helps banks identify vulnerabilities, assess capital adequacy, and develop contingency plans. Regulatory stress tests are required by banking authorities to ensure banks can withstand severe economic shocks and continue serving their customers.

These requirements help banks comply with anti-money laundering regulations and maintain the integrity of the financial system.
- **Anti-Money Laundering (AML)**: Preventing financial crimes - A set of laws, regulations, and procedures designed to prevent criminals from disguising illegally obtained funds as legitimate income. AML requirements include customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and employee training programs. Banks play a critical role in AML efforts by implementing robust compliance programs and reporting suspicious transactions to regulatory authorities.
- **Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)**: Reporting suspicious financial activities - US legislation that requires financial institutions to assist government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering by maintaining records of cash transactions and reporting suspicious activities. The BSA establishes reporting requirements for cash transactions over $10,000 and requires banks to file suspicious activity reports (SARs) when they detect potentially illegal transactions. This law is a cornerstone of US anti-money laundering efforts.
- **Regulation D**: Reserve requirements for banks - A Federal Reserve regulation that establishes reserve requirements for depository institutions, requiring banks to hold a certain percentage of their deposits as reserves either in vault cash or on deposit at Federal Reserve Banks. Reserve requirements help ensure banks maintain sufficient liquidity to meet customer withdrawal demands and serve as a monetary policy tool for the Federal Reserve to influence money supply and interest rates in the economy.
